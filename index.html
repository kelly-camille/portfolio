      <p>I'm currently attending Epicodus and working to achieve a <strong>Certificate in Web and Mobile Development</strong> with a focus in <strong>C#/React.</strong>
        I live in Portland Oregon, which means that in my free time you will likely find me paddling one of the many beautiul mountain lakes near Mt. Hood National Forest. </p>

      <p>I spent most of my life building my career in event sales and marketing, but like so many people in our country, I was laid off in March of 2020. Although it was difficult traversing through 
      unprecidented times, it allowed me to take some time to center my priorities. During this time, I learned that I value work that makes a positive impact on our community, 
      and that I need to be solving complex problems in my day to day workload.</p>
