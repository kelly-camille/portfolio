  <p>I'm currently attending Epicodus and working to achieve a <strong>Certificate in Web and Mobile Development</strong> 
    with a focus in <strong>C#/React.</strong>
    I live in Portland Oregon, which means that in my free time you will likely 
    find me paddling one of the many beautiul mountain lakes near Mt. Hood National Forest.</p>

  <p>I spent most of my life building a succesful career in event sales and marketing, 
          but like so many people in our country, I was laid off in March of 2020.
          Although it was difficult to traverse through unprecidented times, it allowed me to take some time to center my priorities.
          During this time, I learned that I value work that makes a positive impact on our community, 
          and that I need to be solving complex problems in my day to day workload.</p>
